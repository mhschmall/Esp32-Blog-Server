# Esp32-Blog-Server
Simple blogging platform that runs on an ESP32
Yes, this blog runs on an ESP32s3. Currently this site is being served by a ESP32-S3-LCD-1.47, but with very few changes, I think it could run on any ESP32, including the little XIAO SEEED ESP32 S3 Sense which is about the size of a postage stamp. 

I was introduced to this Waveshare product via another project Im sorta contributing to (ESP32 powered offline media server). These boards are pretty feature packed and I definitely like the whole USB stick aspect to using and powering them.

If you're thinking that this is a lot like that Blog on a Wii you would be correct. I was definitely inspired by that project, but the final push was google's AI trying to convince me that an ESP32 could not host blogging software.

The footprint for this is pretty small, just 2 html files and a json file, so you don't need a huge sd card for storage.
